    Mexico, country of southern North America and the third largest country in Latin America, 
after Brazil and Argentina. 
Mexican society is characterized by extremes of wealth and poverty, 
with a limited middle class wedged between an elite cadre of landowners 
and investors on the one hand and masses of rural and urban poor on the other. 
But in spite of the challenges it faces as a developing country, 
Mexico is one of the chief economic and political forces in Latin America. 
    
    It has a dynamic industrial base, vast mineral resources, a wide-ranging service sector, 
and the world’s largest population of Spanish speakers—about two and a half times that of Spain or Colombia. 
As its official name suggests, the Estados Unidos Mexicanos (United Mexican States) 
incorporates 31 socially and physically diverse states and the Federal District.

    More than half of the Mexican people live in the centre of the country, 
whereas vast areas of the arid north and the tropical south are sparsely settled. 
Migrants from impoverished rural areas have poured into Mexico’s cities, 
and nearly four-fifths of Mexicans now live in urban areas. 
    
    Mexico City, the capital, is one of the most populous cities 
and metropolitan areas in the world. Mexico has experienced a series of 
economic booms leading to periods of impressive social gains, followed by busts, 
with significant declines in living standards for the middle and lower classes. 
The country remains economically fragile despite the forging of stronger ties with the United States 
and Canada through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
